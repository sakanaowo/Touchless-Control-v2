# Dev Lifecycle

Coordinate the phase-specific AI DevKit skills instead of running phase details directly.

Required phase skills:

- `dev-worktree` for feature workspace setup and resume.
- `dev-requirements` for phases 1-2: new requirement and requirements review.
- `dev-design` for phase 3: design review.
- `dev-planning` for phases 4 and 6: initial task planning and updates after implementation tasks.
- `dev-implementation` for phases 5 and 7: execute plan and check implementation.
- `dev-testing` for phase 8: write tests and verify coverage.
- `dev-review` for phase 9: final code review.

Supporting skills:

- `memory` for reusable project knowledge during clarification.
- `tdd` for implementation tasks.
- `verify` before completing implementation, implementation checks, testing claims, and review readiness.

## Startup Validation

At the beginning of every `dev-lifecycle` run:

1. Run `npx ai-devkit@latest skill list` to inspect currently installed project skills.
2. Confirm the listed skills include all required phase skills and supporting skills.
3. If any required skill is missing, run `npx ai-devkit@latest skill add --built-in` to install all AI DevKit built-in skills. Then rerun `npx ai-devkit@latest skill list`.
4. If installation fails or a required skill is still missing, stop and report the missing skill names and command output summary. Do not run a phase without its skill.
5. Run `npx ai-devkit@latest lint` to verify the configured AI docs structure.
6. If working on a specific feature, run `npx ai-devkit@latest lint --feature <name>`.
7. If lint fails because project docs are not initialized, run `npx ai-devkit@latest init -a -e claude --built-in --yes`, then rerun lint.

## Plan Before Execution

Before executing any phase:

1. Identify the target feature, current docs state, branch/worktree context, and likely next phase.
2. Propose a concise plan that names the phase skill to use, the docs/files to read, commands to run, expected edits, and verification evidence.
3. Wait for user approval before executing the plan unless the user already gave explicit approval for that exact phase execution.
4. After approval, load and follow only the selected phase skill plus any explicitly required supporting skills.

## Phase Routing

| Phase | Route to | When |
|---|---|---|
| Setup. Workspace | `dev-worktree` | Starting or resuming feature work |
| 1. New Requirement | `dev-requirements` | User wants to add a feature or start `/new-requirement` |
| 2. Review Requirements | `dev-requirements` | Requirements doc needs validation |
| 3. Review Design | `dev-design` | Design doc needs validation against requirements |
| 4. Create Initial Plan | `dev-planning` | Requirements, design, and testing docs are ready for task breakdown |
| 5. Execute Plan | `dev-implementation` | Ready to implement tasks from planning doc |
| 6. Update Planning | `dev-planning` | Auto-trigger after completing any implementation task |
| 7. Check Implementation | `dev-implementation` | Verify code matches design and docs |
| 8. Write Tests | `dev-testing` | Add or verify test coverage |
| 9. Code Review | `dev-review` | Final pre-push review |

Sequential flow: setup -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 after each completed task -> 7 -> 8 -> 9.

## Resuming Work

If the user wants to continue work on an existing feature:

1. Use `dev-worktree` to identify and confirm the target branch/worktree.
2. Run `npx ai-devkit@latest lint --feature <feature-name>` in the active context.
3. Run the phase detector from the installed `dev-lifecycle` skill directory:
   - Resolve `<skill-dir>` as the directory containing this `SKILL.md`.
   - Run `<skill-dir>/scripts/check-status.sh <feature-name>`.
   - Use the suggested phase when proposing the execution plan.

## Backward Transitions

Not every phase moves forward. When a phase reveals problems, route back:

- Requirements review finds fundamental gaps: return to `dev-requirements` Phase 1.
- Design review finds requirements gaps: return to `dev-requirements` Phase 2.
- Design review finds design flaws: stay in `dev-design` and revise design.
- Implementation check finds major deviations: return to `dev-design` if design is wrong, or `dev-implementation` if code is wrong.
- Testing reveals design flaws: return to `dev-design`.
- Review finds blocking issues: return to `dev-implementation` or `dev-testing`.

## Rules

- Use `npx ai-devkit@latest lint` and `npx ai-devkit@latest lint --feature <name>` to discover and validate the configured docs directory. Do not assume `docs/ai`; it is only the default.
- Read existing configured AI docs before changes. Keep diffs minimal.
- Keep feature names aligned with branch/worktree `feature-<name>`.
- New feature docs come from `npx ai-devkit@latest docs init-feature <name>`. Use the paths returned by the command as authoritative.
- Existing feature docs are the paths reported or validated by `npx ai-devkit@latest lint --feature <name>`. If you must infer manually, first resolve the configured docs directory from `.ai-devkit.json` `paths.docs`, falling back to `docs/ai`.
- After each phase, summarize output and suggest the next phase.
- Do not claim completion without fresh verification evidence.
